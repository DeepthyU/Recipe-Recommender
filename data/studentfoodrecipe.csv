Melty Pepperoni Pasta Bake,"Pizza and pasta, all rolled into one. This delicious (and totally student-proof) pepperoni pasta bake is so easy to make.",,,"['200g dried pasta (whatever shape you have)', '1 small jar of tomato pasta sauce', '1 pack cherry tomatoes', 'thinly sliced pepperoni', 'grated mozzarella cheese ']",". First up, we need to preheat the oven to 200℃ (or 180℃ if you're using a fan oven).
. Grab a large pan, fill it up with some water, add a pinch of salt and heat it up until it's boiling. Add the pasta and cook it for a little bit less than what it says on the packet - probably about 6 or 8 minutes.
. Drain the pasta and then mix in the sauce, half of the pepperoni slices, half of the grated cheese and the tomatoes.
. Next, grab a baking dish and pour in the pasta mixture. Put the remaining pepperoni on top and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Then it's into the oven for about 15 minutes.
. And that's it - enjoy some deliciously cheesy, melty, pizza-y pasta bake.

Ultimate Roast Potatoes,"This is the easiest recipe for roast potatoes you'll find. It's totally student-proof. Crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle. Perfect to accompany a delicious roast dinner.",,,"['Around 500g of potatoes', 'Cooking oil', 'Salt and pepper']",". Start by preheating the oven to 200℃ (or 180 if you have a fan oven). Grab a roasting tray and put it in the oven to warm up.
. While that's getting nice and toasty, we also need to get a pan of water heating up on the stove. You'll need quite a bit one.
. Then we need to start the potatoes. You need to peel off the skins and use a knife to cut them into chunks. For a normal sized potato, you'll probably be able to cut it into 4 good sized pieces. Once the water is boiling, put the potatoes in and leave them to cook for around 10 minutes. They should be almost fully cooked. Drain the water and set aside.
. Remember that tray in the oven? We need to add the oil. You're going to need quite a lot, to make a layer on the bottom on the pan. Probably about 100ml if you want to measure. Once you've poured in the oil, it needs to back in the oven so the oil gets nice and hot.
. And then, we're ready to (very carefully) add the potatoes to the tray. They should sizzle when you put them in the oil. Then back into the oven for total of 45 minutes, remembering to give them a little mix around every 15 mins.
. Once they're done, they should be golden and crispy. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on top, and that's it. Enjoy some amazing roast potatoes!

. Then we need to start the potatoes. You need to peel off the skins and use a knife to cut them into chunks. For a normal sized potato, you'll probably be able to cut it into 4 good sized pieces. Once the water is boiling, put the potatoes in and leave them to cook for around 10 minutes. They should be almost fully cooked. Drain the water and set aside.
. Remember that tray in the oven? We need to add the oil. You're going to need quite a lot, to make a layer on the bottom on the pan. Probably about 100ml if you want to measure. Once you've poured in the oil, it needs to back in the oven so the oil gets nice and hot.
. And then, we're ready to (very carefully) add the potatoes to the tray. They should sizzle when you put them in the oil. Then back into the oven for total of 45 minutes, remembering to give them a little mix around every 15 mins.
. Once they're done, they should be golden and crispy. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on top, and that's it. Enjoy some amazing roast potatoes!

Place the baking tray into the oven and roast for 45 minutes, shuffling the tray half-way through to ensure they are done all over. 
. Meanwhile, mix the chopped tomatoes, mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes together in a mixing bowl with the pesto until coated. Arrange a bed of washed spinach on a plate. Once the chickpeas are done, spoon them in with the pesto mixture and incorporate them. 
. Spoon half of the chick-pea and mozzarella mix over the bed of spinach and keep the other half in the fridge for later or serve it up for a friend on another bed of spinach! Sprinkle over some grated Parmesan and serve with a lemon wedge. Enjoy!

. Occasionally give the dhal a stir to ensure all the flavours are mixing. The lentils will absorb the water and thicken the dhal- add more water if needs be. Once cooked, garnish the dhal with some coriander. I have served my dhal with brown rice and green beans
